Setting failure-prone New Year's Resolutions is something of a national pastime in the US. On or around December 31 of each year, people commit to ambitious goals for the upcoming year — exercise regularly, eat healthier, lose weight, save money, read more, etc. In most cases, the resolutions end up being [short lived](https://nypost.com/2018/12/21/new-years-resolutions-last-exactly-this-long/).

A study by Strava found that the largest number of failures in exercise related resolutions happens on January 12; a study by Dr. Luciani found that 80% of resolutions fail by the first week in February; and a University of Scranton study found that only 8 percent of people achieve their resolutions.

Putting aside the fad of setting ambitious New Year's Resolutions, setting year-long goals _can_ be a powerful catalyst for progress, whatever form that progress may take.

However, there is an art to setting productive annual goals. In short, the goals must be **measurable**, **flexible**, and **routine**.

### Prep work

Before you get to the process of establishing your goals, you first need to know what areas you want to focus on. That process requires a bit of self-reflection and self-awareness. What things do you care about? What do you value? Where do you want to see progress?

The most common areas people tend to focus on are their health, their finances, their education, and their career, but you may choose to focus elsewhere. Perhaps you have a personal passion — photography or scuba diving or music — that you want to pursue with more vigor. Whatever you choose, try to limit yourself to no more than three focus areas. That will maximize your chance of making progress on the areas that matter most to you.

### Make them measurable

With your focus areas in mind, it's time to figure out how you will measure progress. That boils down to answering a surprisingly difficult question: what metric best captures the behavior you want to incentivize?

If your intention is to read more, maybe the goal should be related to the number of books you read. Even better, the goal could be related to the number of _pages_ you read since that more closely measures the thing you want to increase. Reading an especially long novel would contribute proportionally more to your goal despite being just one book. The former incentivizes you to read shorter books (or more realistically, disincentivizes you from reading especially long books); the latter makes book length irrelevant, which is probably a good thing.

If your intention is to improve your health, maybe the goal should be related to how frequently you exercise. Even better, the goal could be related to the _time_ spent exercising. Or, if you want to incentivize yourself to both eat healthier and exercise more, perhaps your goal could be related to your average weight.

Other examples include time spent meditating for a mindfulness goal, money saved for a financial goal, number of steps taken for an activity goal, or number of words written for a creativity goal.

### Make them flexible

Now that you have metrics in mind that will incentivize the right behavior, it's time to translate those into actual goals.

This might be the single most common thing people mess up when setting goals for the simple reason that people don't make their goals flexible enough.

Consider an example of wanting to exercise more. Most people translate this to a goal along the lines of, "Go to the gym two times a week." That might seem like a reasonable goal, but what happens when you travel or you get sick and you don't make it twice in a week? Do you fail your goal?

If you went two or three times every other week of the year it seems silly to fail your goal. But even if you give yourself a pass since you were sick, there's something to be said about the psychology of streaks. As soon as you go that first week without making it to the gym twice, it'll be that much easier to come up with reasons for not going to the gym twice in other weeks.

Instead, you should make your goals _flexible_. Or, as I tend to describe it, write the goals in such a way that you can still achieve them even if you fall behind at some points.

In the case the exercise goal, you could make it

TODO!

Bonus: set a “realistic” goal and a “stretch” goal. If you blow past your original goal, it can be nice to have a

### Make them routine

Frequency helps since they’ll stay on top of mind
Update your tracking of them at most once a week, and ideally more than that until you get into a rhythm
